# Iearthicraft-StartScript
Windows and Linux Install and start scripts for minecraft forge servers

Automatically downloads and starts the Minecraft Forge installer for the version the script is for.
Master branch is for 1.7.10 (Using the latest forge for 1.7.10, checked monthly)
There are currently Branches for:
1.8.9
1.9
1.9.4

When 1.9 or 1.9.4 comes into general use, I will merge it into the master and move 1.7.10 to another branch.
Feel free to request other Minecraft versions! I can easily make a new version of the script. Please message me on GitHub or on Curse, though! Do NOT make an issue for that!
If there is an issue with Distro compatibility for the Linux script, please DO create an issue, tell me the Distro, and tell me at what point it fails. Any problems with the Windows version should also be created as an issue, UNLESS it is functionality or cosmetic related. I WILL IGNORE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES.

Thank you for checking out my scripts!
